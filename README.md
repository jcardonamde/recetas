# recetas
This application is developed in python with Flask. The app allows users to register, perform login validation, create cooking recipes, and the user who owns a recipe is the only one who can edit or delete their recipe. The others could only consult it.

I use the CRUD model, where the concepts of MVC, OOP, value interpolation, modularization, and one-to-many relationships are applied to the database. Bootstrap 5 was used in the frontend. The ERD model was created with MySQL Workbench. It was deployed on Ubuntu 20.04 using the EC2 instance service on AWS. Visit: http://50.17.116.23
